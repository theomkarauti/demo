6.Threads :-
	Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple
	threads simultaneously.

	A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
	Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.

                Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism.

	A thread can be created by implementing the Runnable interface and 
	overriding the run() method. Then a Thread object can be created and 
	the start() method called. The Main thread in Java is the one that
	begins executing when the program starts.
